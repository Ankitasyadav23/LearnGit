
Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Hereâ€™s a quick summary:

Version Control: Allows multiple developers to work on a project without overwriting each other's changes.
Repository (Repo): A container that holds all the project files and the entire history of changes.
Commit: Records changes to the repository with a unique ID and message.
Branch: A separate line of development, allowing for parallel work on different features or bug fixes.
Merge: Combines changes from different branches into one.
Clone: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
Push/Pull: Push sends local commits to a remote repo; Pull fetches and merges changes from a remote repo.
Staging Area: A place to review changes before committing.
Key Commands:

git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone [URL]: Clone a repository.
git add [file]: Stage changes for commit.
git commit -m "message": Commit staged changes.
git status: Check the status of changes.
git push: Push commits to a remote repository.
git pull: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
git branch: List or create branches.
git checkout [branch]: Switch to another branch.
git merge [branch]: Merge a branch into the current branch.
Git helps with collaboration, version tracking, and managing code efficiently in both small and large projects.
